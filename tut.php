					Import to Inkscape the image you want to vectorize and click the image to select it.

			nodes of the selected path in this manner: first, last, second, second last, third.... To install an Inkscape extension follow 

			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jessyink/wiki/Installation" target="_blank">these instructions</a>. If you would like to know more

			I want to satin stitch the border of this leaf and start by copying the inner part and reduce the size slightly. Make sure that the path is unclosed at the tip of the leaf. If the path is a closed path you need to

			 select the node where the stitching should start and find the "Break path at selected nodes"-button in the upper left corner of your screen.';

		$textArr[]='Then I use the Add Nodes extension where I can set the maximum segment length for the nodes around this path i.e. the spacing between

			select more than one element) and press the "Join selected end nodes with a new segment"-button on the upper left corner of your screen.';

		$textArr[]='Now you are ready for the netting effect. You will be asked for "seroke with". That is just a misspelled "stroke with" and I use

			pops up, but we will for now set most of them to zero. To adjust the direction and spacing of the filling you have to select the node tool and play around 

			with the little yellow circles and diamonds. A better description of this effect can be found in this <a href="http://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Drawing_a_smiley_face" 

			target="_blank">tutorial</a> from the <a href="http://egg-bot.com" target="_blank">Eggbot project</a>. This project is about a robot that can draw paths on round objects 

			like eggs for example and use Inkscape to digitize the pen-paths. This project offer many ideas for digitizing embroideries using Inkscape too as it\'s a bit 

			of the same story. For creating filled regions I specifically recommend <a href="http://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Creating_filled_regions" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>.';
